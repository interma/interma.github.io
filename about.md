This is the Chinese document site for HAWQ. 
Powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Welcome to contribute to it (either in Chinese or English). 
A brief way to achieve it:

1. run `git clone git@github.com:yydzero/yydzero.github.io.git`
2. add a new post by writing a new file under *_posts/* dir
3. git push with a short comment (with author names in both comments and posts)
