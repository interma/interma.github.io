This is the Chinese document site for Greenplum Database. You can find out more
info about the developing of Greenplum DB at
[https://github.com/greenplum-db](https://github.com/greenplum-db), 
as well as detailed documentation at
[http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io](http://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io).

You can find how to compile, install, and configure the Greenplum DB here, but 
we strongly hope you can also contribute to it (either in Chinese or English). 
A brief way to achieve it:

1. run `git clone git@github.com:yydzero/yydzero.github.io.git`
2. add a new post by writing a new file under *_posts/* dir
3. git push with a short comment (with author names in both comments and posts)

Post template is based on markdown, for more information, please visit
[Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) or [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Any question please do not hesitate to contact:
