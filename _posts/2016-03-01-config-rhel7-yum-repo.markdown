To install dependent 3rd-party libraries, we use YUM to install them. But the default
repo of yum on RHEL 7 is really slow, I suggest you use below yum repo from USTC or
163:

* [USTC mirror](https://lug.ustc.edu.cn/wiki/mirrors/help/centos)

* [163 mirror](http://mirrors.163.com/.help/centos.html)

For example, for 163, you can:
1. download the repo file from: http://mirrors.163.com/.help/CentOS7-Base-163.repo

2. modify the file using
 ```
 sudo sed -i 's/\$releasever/7/g' CentOS7-Base-163.rep
 ```

3. copy it to /etc/yum.repo.d/

4. run 'yum makecache' to verify it

5. enjoy

Besides, sometime you may meet a problem that 'redhat.repo' is always re-created
and invoked by yum, it's boring and slow. You can try following way to disable
it (maybe not the best way):

```
    vim /etc/yum.config and set 'plugins=0'
```

For example, PostGIS requires at least these 3rd party libraries: json-c, geos, proj4, gdal and expat. The libaraies json-c and expat can be download from [base source][1], the other three
libraies need to be download from [epel source][2].

[2]: {{ site.url }}/download/CentOS-Base.repo

Besides, you may need to download the key from:

```
    wget http://mirrors.163.com/centos/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7
    wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7
    sudo mv RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7 /etc//etc/pki/rpm-gpg
    sudo mv RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7 /etc//etc/pki/rpm-gpg
```
