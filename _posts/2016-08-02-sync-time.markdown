### Why?

In following case you need to sync time:

* connect to cloud service, for example, Amazon S3. If the local time differs from server time too much, the S3 service request will be rejected.
* any time-sensitive cases you may meet 

### How?

    sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com

_NOTE_: If you want to sync the time in a DOCKER, you need to perform previous command in HOST.
